    Release notes


This program is a "how to" about libmad's low-level API. The intended
use of this program is to serve as tutorial or demonstration for
programmers wiling to learn how the currently undocumented library API
can be used. As a side effect the program can be used to decode MPEG
audio streams to raw PCM samples.

Madlld was written on an Unix system, dependencies on the POSIX
interface are handled by providing an alternate behavior on non-Unix
systems. The hosting operating system should nonetheless provide
standard streams redirection. The program structure is very simple: it
reads an audio MPEG stream from stdin and writes raw big-endian stereo
16 bits signed samples on stdout. The source code is heavily
commented, you are advised to read it bottom-up as that's were this
package purpose is.


==============================================================================
Release status
==============================================================================

This second release was tested against MAD versions 0.14.0b, 0.14.1b,
0.14.2b, 0.15.0b, and 0.15.1b. There is no known bug.


==============================================================================
Installation
==============================================================================

This program is distributed in source code only, you shall build it
first. Follow the instructions bellow to build and install malld on
Unix systems.

1. Be sure that the MAD suite is installed on your system. As of the
   14th of January 2003, the MAD suite version 0.15.0b can be freely
   obtained from <URL:http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/>. The
   suite is composed of three archives: libid3tag, libmad, and
   madplay. Madlld use only libmad.

2. Configure the build process by editing the Makefile. In-lined
   comments will guide you there.

3. Run "make". If you are using gcc, you can safely ignore warnings
   about the use of braced-groups and the "asm" keyword. Theses are
   part of macros defined by the mad.h header.

4. Test the built binaries by placing an audio MPEG stream in the
   build directory as a file named "test.mp3". If sox(1) is installed
   on your system them type "make test". Else type "make test.cdr" and
   use any tools of your choice to check the PCM samples that were
   store in the file "test.cdr".

5. If step 3 succeeded then you're ready to install the program with
   "make install".

6. If your brand new installation required some changes to the
   program, please send unified diffs to the author (see the Contact
   section bellow).

7. If your brand new installation was done on an operating system not
   listed in this document or against an also unlisted MAD version,
   please report your system details/versions to the author (see the
   Contact section bellow).

8. Optionally you can choose to build the postscript documentation.
   You'll need the a2ps command (version 4.10 or up), and the psutils
   package. You can obtain the two of then at theses locations:

       a2ps
         http://www.inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/

       psutils
         http://gershwin.ens.fr/vdaniel/Doc-Locale/Outils-Gnu-Linux/PsUtils/

   Type "make ps". This will build two documents: 1) a pretty-printed
   version of the source code, and 2) the formated manual page. Both
   are made for A4 and letter paper sizes.

   You can also use the pre-formated documents available at the madlld
   distribution site: http://www.bsd-dk.dk/~elrond/audio/madlld/#docs


Users of non-Unix systems wishing to compile this program are on their
own. They must arrange to compile the madlld.c and bstdfile.c modules,
then link the resulting object files against the MAD library.

The compilation should yield no trouble as most of the program was
written in an almost pure ANSI C fashion. The only part that diverges
from the specs is the function dealing with command-line parsing. On
Unix systems we use the getopt() function; a crude replacement is
provided if your system does not provide it. The use the getopt part
or the alternative is governed by the detection at pre-processing time
of several well known pre-defined macros present on Unix systems. If
your preprocessor does not define theses macros and you have the
getopt() function you can still use it if you arrange to pre-define to
any value the HAVE_GETOPT macro.

When the alternative command-line parser is used, the usage rules
listed in the manual page are not applicable. For more information
just invoke the madlld filter with any number bogus non-numeric
arguments.

Questions, bug reports, patches, etc. are welcome. Please mail your
queries to < madlld at phoe dot frmug dot org >. If you value your
privacy you can send OpenPGP encrypted mails, the author's key is
available on public keyrings under the 0606CEF7 ID, it has the
following fingerprint:
